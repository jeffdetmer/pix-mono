# pix-prompts

Pi extension — system-prompt injection (SOP.md + repo directives).

## What it does

Injects structured context into the system prompt at the start of every agent turn via `before_agent_start`. It first replaces Pi's default coding-assistant identity line with `You are Pix Coding Agent. You help users accomplish any task they request.` Two sources are then injected in order: the bundled `SOP.md` (the pix agent operating spec baseline), followed by repo-root directive files the Pi host does not load (`GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`). Each source is wrapped in a labelled XML tag for provenance.

The bundled `SOP.md` sets the agent style to [ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English](https://asd-ste100.org) under §6: short common words, the active voice, simple tenses, and a next-action-first reply shape. It carries a condensed form of the rules and cites the skill `woosal1337/blog@asd-ste100` for the full spec.

Injection is **idempotent and host-aware**. A file is skipped when either our own tag is already present (retry turns) or the Pi host has injected that same absolute path as `<project_instructions path="...">`. Pi natively owns `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; pix-prompts intentionally does not scan them, preventing duplicate injection when host and extension paths use different normalization.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@xynogen/pix-prompts
```

> Bundled in [`@xynogen/pix-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xynogen/pix-core). Install it alone only if you do not use pix-core.
